Books
* "Coaching for Performance" by John Witmore. Origin for GROW framework [Booko](https://booko.com.au/w/10356141/coaching-for-performance-6th-edition-the-principles-and-practice-of-coaching-and-leadership-fully-revised-edition-for-2024) (Booko lets you compare prices - including shipping - across bookstore)
* "The Tao of Coaching" by Max Landsberg. Also on GROW. I found it more digestible than the Whitmore book.
